      <div class="entry">
        <p>In the everlasting battle of terminal text editors between the Emacs gang and the Vim gang, I firmly stand with the Vim side—well, Neovim, to be precise. Switching to Neovim felt like diving headfirst into a deep rabbit hole of endless possibilities: learning Vim bindings and configuring almost everything from scratch.</p>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>So, I spilled coffee on my laptop and accidentally killed it. My mother always told me that all addictions eventually take a toll on you, but I never imagined it would happen this way. I hope to repair the laptop myself in the near future. It served me well for 5 years, and perhaps it was time to replace it.</p>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>For almost 20 years, I have been in a love/hate relationship with Windows. I started my computer journey with Windows XP and Vista, and I have consistently used all versions of Windows since. My experience with Windows has never been as good as many people think it should be. One of the biggest lies we often hear is that “Windows just works.”</p>

        <p>After pondering it for exactly five seconds, I decided to start a blog where I can shout all the ideas that randomly pop into my mind. Hence, I named this adventure “Random Access Thoughts,” a name that perfectly captures my nerdiness towards computers.</p>
