  <h1>I Never Gave Up, Because She Never Did</h1>

  <div class="entry">
    <p><strong>Strength can be drawn from anywhere, for me, it came from a shining blue star named Hoshimachi Suisei.</strong></p>

<p>This might be a strange place to start, but I’m not a particularly religious person. I grew up in a Catholic household, went to Catholic school, and did the usual rituals: monthly church, learning the catechism. But over time, I strayed from those beliefs and became what I’d call a pragmatic atheist.</p>

<p>Still, I’ve always respected when people say, “I believe in God because He gave me strength in my darkest times.” That sentiment always stuck with me: the idea of finding something or someone that helps you keep going.</p>

<p>And while it may sound odd or even blasphemous to some, that source of strength for me… was a VTuber. Not just any VTuber, but the unstoppable, hardworking, and ever-glowing <strong>Hoshimachi Suisei</strong>. This post is a thank-you letter to her, for never giving up, for being authentic, and for teaching me that perseverance, no matter how quiet or difficult, can truly shine.</p>

<h2 id="the-spark">The Spark</h2>

<p>I became a Hoshiyomi back in 2020, during the early days of the pandemic. It started with her cover of “E-ma e-ma,” but it was her rendition of “King” that completely pulled me in. From there, I discovered her original songs, her streams, and more importantly: her story.</p>

<p>At the time, I was doing an exchange program abroad as part of my undergrad. It was a big step, exciting on the surface, but incredibly isolating underneath. New place, unfamiliar language, a long way from home. During those quiet, lonely nights, it was Suisei’s music that brought me comfort. I’d loop <strong>“Comet”</strong> and <strong>“Ghost”</strong> in my dorm, letting her voice echo through the silence. It wasn’t just music, it was a reminder that I wasn’t alone. That someone out there was also pushing forward, even through uncertainty.</p>

<p>One of the things that stood out to me then (and still does) is her refusal to play the damsel waiting for rescue. In <em>Stellar Stellar</em> and so many of her performances, there’s this recurring theme: <strong>she isn’t waiting for a prince, she <em>is</em> the prince.</strong> That mindset hit me hard. She was doing what I wanted to do: carving a path on her own terms, no matter how hard it got.</p>

<p>Suisei wasn’t just someone I listened to; she became someone I looked up to.</p>

<h2 id="the-fall">The Fall</h2>

<p>After graduating, I wanted to chase the dream of every young physicist: to get into a direct-entry PhD program and do research in theoretical particle physics. I applied widely, poured my hopes into every application.</p>

<p>And I was rejected by every single one.</p>

<p>I felt devastated. I had worked so hard, planned everything out, and still wasn’t enough. I thought that was it, that I had failed for good.</p>

<h2 id="the-choice-to-keep-going">The Choice to Keep Going</h2>

<p>But Suisei was still in my mind, and in my headphones. Her journey from obscurity to the big stage, all while staying true to herself, reminded me of something important: <strong>you don’t stop just because the first door didn’t open</strong>. You find another one, or build your own.</p>

<p>So, I took a breath, cried a little, and went back to my alma mater. I applied to a Master’s program, not as prestigious, but one where I could regroup, rebuild, and keep trying.</p>

<p>That choice changed everything.</p>

<h2 id="the-climb">The Climb</h2>

<p>During those two years, I met an incredible advisor who helped me shift into a new field: Computational Soft Matter Physics. He helped me confront fears I didn’t even know I had, pushed me forward when I hesitated, and gave me space to grow as a researcher and as a person.</p>

<p>I made my first poste, gave my first conference talk, submitted a paper, wrote a thesis, and started to believe in myself again. But of course, there were rough days, days full of imposter syndrome, exhaustion, and self-doubt.</p>

<p>On those days, I looked to Suisei again. I even started painting my nails in her signature blue, a small, visible reminder not to give up. Whenever I caught a glimpse of it, it felt like a quiet promise to myself: <em>keep going, like she does</em>.</p>

<h2 id="the-leap">The Leap</h2>

<p>When it was time to decide on my next step, apply abroad again, or stay in my comfort zone, I froze. I have a habit of sabotaging myself when it matters most. But that blue nail reminded me of why I started. And who inspired me to start again.</p>

<p>I applied.</p>

<p>And this time, I got in.</p>

<h2 id="the-new-chapter">The New Chapter</h2>

<p>I’m writing this now from my dorm room, on the other side of the world, after my first day as a PhD student at a really good university. I went to the group office, met my new colleagues, and took the first real step into this next stage of my life.</p>

<p>It was a good day.</p>

<p>And I wouldn’t be here if it weren’t for the strength I found in Suisei’s music, her story, and her spirit. I still don’t know what the future holds for me, but I am only certain of one thing: to keep pushing forward as she has always done.</p>

<h2 id="thank-you">Thank You</h2>

<p>I’ve never told anyone this story, not my friends, not even my family. But Suisei has been with me through it all: from the loneliness of my undergrad exchange, to the heartbreak of rejection, to the quiet victories that brought me here.</p>

<p>She reminded me to move forward, even if it’s just a little at a time. She reminded me that I didn’t need to be saved, that I could be the one to keep walking.</p>

<p>So thank you, Suisei. For your music. For your strength. For refusing to give up.</p>

<p>You are the prince of your own story, and because of you, I’m trying to be the same.</p>

<p>ありがとう、すいちゃん。</p>

<p>You’re an inspiration to millions, and to me.</p>
