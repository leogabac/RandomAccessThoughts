# Random Access Thoughts

A personal blog where I just dump whatever is crossing my mind. I typicall talk about computers, FOSS, anime, and music, but mostly computers.

This blog was built using the [Jekyll Now template](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now/tree/master) and is hosted on GitHub Pages for simplicity. If you want to build something similar yourself, go to the repo for more information :D.
