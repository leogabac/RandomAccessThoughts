After pondering it for exactly five seconds, I decided to start a blog where I can shout all the ideas that randomly pop into my mind. Hence, I named this adventure "Random Access Thoughts," a name that perfectly captures my nerdiness towards computers.

Nevertheless, I will not write about tech and computers all the time. In general, I’ll share a bit about everything I’m into at the moment. If I were to describe my hobby, it would be trying new hobbies every so often.

Currently, I’m a big computer and coffee nerd who majored in Physics and is now suffering through grad school, so expect some cool scientific posts from time to time. Most recently, inspired by PewDiePie, I decided to teach myself how to draw. In fact, the (past) logo on the homepage of this blog is an original character I created when I was bored. Her name is Reiko Hiramoto, and someday I’ll turn her into an AI VTuber like [Neuro-sama](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLHmLrj4pHHg3-iBJn_CqxA).
